<p> - One person is needed to pick up the food from the restaurant at about 11:20am so they can be at the soup kitchen by 11:30am with the food.</p>

<p> - Someone will open the kitchen, prepare coffee & juice & set out supplies.  They should be there at about 11:30am.</p>

<p> - During the lunch hour about 4 people are needed .... this will most likley include the pickup & prep people who will stay through the lunch hour.</p>
