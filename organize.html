<h5>Organize Your Team</h5><p>


<p>Ideally you can have 4 or 5 people to work each day that your team volunteers, but most often 3 is an expected number of workers.</p>

<p> - One person is needed to pick up the food from the restaurant at about 11:20am so they can be at the soup kitchen by 11:30am with the food.</p>

<p> - Someone will open the kitchen, prepare coffee & juice & set out supplies. They should be there at about 11:30am. There is a binder with duty check list on counter by fridge.</p>

<p> - During the lunch hour, 3 people are ideal .... this will most likely include the pickup & prep people who will stay through the lunch hour.</p>

<p> - There will be one behind the counter serving up soup, etc. The other two will serve the meals to guests, refilling refreshments and wait on tables.</p>

<p> - One or two volunteers need to stay behind to wash tables, clean floors and bathrooms. They should be able to be finished by 1:30 or 2:00pm</p>

<p> If you have any questions, please contact one of our volunteer co-ordinators.</p>
